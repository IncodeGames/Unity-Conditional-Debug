# Unity-Conditional-Debug
Library that wraps the methods of Unity's Debug class, marking them as Conditional to allow easy stripping from release builds while keeping stack traces.

Grab the Debug.DLL from the bin/Debug folder to get access to basic UnityEngine.Debug wrappings, or add further wrappings/functionality to the Debug.cs class and rebuild the project.
